# MorphMining

MorphMining is an interactive mining plugin that adds a unique element to the vanilla mining system. This plugin adds that little extra incentive to mine. Upon mining certain ores the player has a chance of receiving tiered `Artifacts & Crates`. The artifacts can be sold in an in-game GUI for server currency. Crates can be taken to the analyzation menu to be opened at a cost per rarity. (Archivist) This plugin is made for survival SMP servers but can be useful in other server types.
